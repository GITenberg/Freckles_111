description: Freckles is a one-handed, plucky waif of an orphan, who has been raised
  since infancy in a Chicago orphanage and yet speaks with a powerful Irish accent.
  He applies for a job guarding timber in the swamp, and is accepted despite his youth
  and the disability of his having only one hand. He insists that the name given him
  in the orphanage ""is no more my name than it is yours."" Freckles develops an interest
  in the wildlife of the swamp and in natural history, and falls in love with the
  Swamp Angel. The story's primary action involves his self-education, his loyalty
  to his empl.
